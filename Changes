        Changes in the Sequence objects
0.16    2007/04/12
        The Graphics::Feature module fixed, but Endre found some bug :-(
0.15    2007/04/12

0.14    2007/04/01
        New module Util::Run::Fuzznuc.
	New modification in Graphics::Feature, because it is not correct.
0.13    2007/03/28
        The motifs in the Graphics::Feature module drawed incorrectly. Now fixed. Maybe
0.12    2007/03/19
        The motifs in the Graphics::Feature module drawed correctly
        The ClusterSubset module get_all_seqs method returns sorted sequences
0.11    2007/03/14
        The motifs is the Graphics::Feature module drawed reverse order. Fixed
        The first sequence in the graphics is a reference species
        The UTR doesn't hide the species name
        If no have motifs the Graphics::Feature module also create picture
0.10    2007/02/15
        Add new object (Util::Run::Admin) to handle the running processes
0.09    2007/02/10
        Add new methods to Cluster.pm (get_subset_by_type, get_availables_types)
        Add new methods to Util::Run::Mofext object (run_background, get_results_from_file)
        Now you can run mofext in the background.
0.08    2007/01/31
        Add new method for Sequence.pm (get_raw_seq)
        Fixed the motif drawing in Graphics::Feature module
        Fixed the get_fasta method (add a new line to the end :-))
        Add new method for SequenceFeature.pm (length)
        Add new object (Util::Run::Mofext)
